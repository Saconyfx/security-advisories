# Public Disclosure: Stored XSS in Markdown Block – Piranha CMS 12.0 #

<b>Title:</b><br>
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Markdown Content Block of Piranha CMS 12.0

<b>Summary</b><br>
Piranha CMS v12.0 contains a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) bypass in the Markdown content block used within Standard Page and Standard Archive Page types. After the vendor added DOMPurify in v12.0 to address the earlier Markdown XSS (CVE-2024-55341.which affected v11.1), certain edge-case HTML/JS payloads remain unsanitized. An authenticated user can insert crafted JavaScript into a Markdown block; the payload is stored and executed during page preview and again when the page is published and viewed publicly. This represents a bypass of the prior remediation, expanding impact from editor-only execution to execution affecting preview and published pages and thus both authenticated and unauthenticated viewers.
