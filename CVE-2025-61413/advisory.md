# Public Disclosure: Stored XSS in Markdown Block – Piranha CMS 12.0 #

<b>Title:</b><br>
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Markdown Content Block of Piranha CMS 12.0

<b>Summary</b><br>
Piranha CMS 12.0 contains a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Markdown content block used within Standard Page and Standard Archive Page types. When an authenticated user inserts unsanitized JavaScript into a Markdown block, the payload is stored and later executed during page preview or public access. This exposes the platform to persistent XSS, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary scripts in the browser of anyone who accesses the rendered page.
